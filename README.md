The weather app
===================


Hey! This is my first time typing a markdown document. So much for introducing myself. Lets get to the point

----------


What does it do?
-------------

Its actually one of those superb application you may or may not find on the internet. Basically, what it does is... help you survive. If you ever wondered how you could look out for thunderstorm, mist, fog, sandstorms or whateva weather.

All you have to do it type your city's name and you'll get the results. It shows your current weather, in case you live underground. It also shows different times of the day with the condition and of course the temperatures with it.

Simple, easy and a must have app if you're planning on increasing your survival chances in the nearby future.
